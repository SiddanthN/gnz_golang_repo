# gnz_golang_repo

Note: I am currently building this repo for the first time using Golang and would be conitnuing to do so till midnight, hoping to close it by that time. Please be in the loop to be able to go through the final version of it. 

Apologies for the delay, as always figuring it out till I make it! \:)


This repository is intended for a short period of validity. 

This repository contains Golang web application back-end service to operate on PSI (Pollutant Standard Index) data.
